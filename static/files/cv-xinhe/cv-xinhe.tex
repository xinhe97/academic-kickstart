% The datetabular environment takes one argument, which is the width of the left date column. As seen here:
%   9em is a good choice for "dual-date" formats (e.g. Sep 2015 - Nov 2019).
%   4em is a good choice for month/year dates (Sep 2014).
%   2em is a good choice for year-only dates (as seen in the publications)
\begin{datetabular}{9em}
% This is just a tabular environment, for the most part. The dateentry command has been defined for
% convienence. It takes two arguments, the first is the date and the second is whatever you wish placed to the right.
